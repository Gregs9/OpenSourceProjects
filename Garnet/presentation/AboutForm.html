        <h1>What is this website?</h1>
        <p>This is my video hosting website, or as I call it "The Garnet". This is a public, open-source web application
            I
            have been working on in my spare time in order to learn and apply new programming techniques I've learned
            over time.
            This project has helped me learn a lot more about full-stack development, both front and backend. This
            project is the result of hundreds of hours of learning, reviewing, reiterating and improving my skills als a
            developer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This website is currently under continous development, I would like to expand this project even further by
            adding additional features.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Future plans</h1>
        <p>
            Here is a list of features I would like to add in the future:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Rewrite CSS to use the BEM standard. This would allow the CSS to be independent from the HTML layout of a page by giving all elements a class name, and only adding styles to these classes.</li>
            <li>Add a comment section to videos: This would take a bit of time but is something I would defenitely be able to do easily. However, due to being unable to moderate this website and everything posted here, I have decided not to implement this feature (yet). I might add this feature later, but I would have to disable it for all users except administrators.</li>
            <li>Rework the design: I would like to improve the design of this website, as it currently doesn't look as good as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>Users can currently only upload thumbnails in the .webp file format, I would like the user to be able to upload .jpg and .png files too, and have it converted to .webp upon uploading.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Disclaimers</h1>

            This website is for demo purposes only and serves no purpose outside of that. As a student I cannot
